### Software & Language
We used Eclipse as the IDE and Github for the source control. We programmed this project in Java.

### Run and Compile
In order to run this program successfully, you must add two command line parameters:
* args[0] -> will store the .dat file
* args[1] -> will store the number of frames

It’s important to note that when running this program to follow this format for args[0] “filename.dat” and for args[1] it must take an integer value (greater than 0). Because we added an additional feature the program will look like it’s paused for a moment after it displays the average number of page faults with a specific number of frames and then it will output the data for the graph.
